    "## Complex Patient Profile: Sarah Johnson\n",
    "\n",
    "The patient profile for Sarah Johnson simulates a real-world medical scenario. Sarah is a 68-year-old female with a history of multiple chronic conditions, including atrial fibrillation (AF) and peripheral arterial disease (PAD). These conditions represent a common intersection of cardiovascular diseases, often requiring complex management strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Aspects of the Profile:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Chronic Conditions**: \n",
    "   Sarah's chronic conditions such as atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia make her a high-risk patient for cardiovascular events, particularly stroke. Her management involves balancing rhythm and rate control strategies, as well as anticoagulation therapy to reduce stroke risk. Her **CHA2DS2-VASc score** (which assesses stroke risk in AF patients) is 4, placing her in a category where anticoagulation is recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Medication Management**: \n",
    "   Sarah‚Äôs current medications, including **Flecainide** (for rhythm control) and **Apixaban** (for anticoagulation), are reflective of standard care practices for managing atrial fibrillation. The inclusion of drugs like **Metoprolol** and **Atorvastatin** addresses co-morbidities such as hypertension and high cholesterol, which often accompany AF.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Lifestyle Factors**:\n",
    "   Sarah‚Äôs smoking history, though she quit 5 years ago, remains a significant risk factor for PAD and cardiovascular disease. Her active lifestyle (4-5 days of physical activity per week) and adherence to a heart-healthy, low-sodium diet indicate positive lifestyle interventions, which are critical components in managing her conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Lab Results and Vital Signs**:\n",
    "   Sarah‚Äôs recent lab results (e.g., INR, creatinine, cholesterol levels) are crucial in monitoring both her cardiovascular risk and the effectiveness of her medications. For example, her **INR** of 2.4 suggests her anticoagulation therapy is well-managed, reducing her risk of stroke while balancing the risk of bleeding.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Mental Health and Preferences**:\n",
    "   The profile includes a brief mental health assessment indicating that Sarah experiences anxiety but not depression, which is important in understanding her emotional response to her chronic conditions and treatments. Her treatment preferences for minimally invasive procedures and non-opioid pain management reflect patient-centered care approaches, aligning with her values and goals for treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Recent Visits and Surgical History**:\n",
    "   Sarah‚Äôs recent visits for atrial fibrillation and PAD management illustrate ongoing management of her conditions. The mention of considering **catheter ablation** reflects a common decision point for AF patients who experience recurrence despite pharmacological treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Risk Scores**:\n",
    "   Tools such as the **CHA2DS2-VASc score** and **HAS-BLED score** are used in clinical practice to assess stroke risk and bleeding risk in AF patients, respectively. Sarah‚Äôs scores are 4 (moderate-to-high stroke risk) and 2 (moderate bleeding risk), which helps guide therapeutic decisions, such as whether to continue anticoagulation therapy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simulating a Real-World Scenario:\n",
    "This profile simulates the comprehensive details a healthcare provider would need to consider in managing a complex patient with cardiovascular disease. From medication management to understanding patient preferences and assessing risk through validated tools, Sarah's profile is representative of real patient cases in cardiology. Healthcare providers can use this information to make informed, evidence-based decisions, such as whether to recommend catheter ablation or adjust anticoagulation therapy based on her risk scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disclaimer:\n",
    "**This patient profile is fictional and is used for demonstration purposes only.** The data does not represent any real individual, and the use case is designed to illustrate how AI tools like Azure AI Search, LlamaIndex, and CrewAI can assist in medical decision-making by automating the retrieval of relevant medical guidelines and generating patient-specific recommendations.\n"

       "**`Final Response:`** For a 68-year-old female with atrial fibrillation and peripheral arterial disease, the recommended option to reduce stroke risk is anticoagulation therapy. Specifically, the CHA2DS2-VASc score should be utilized to assess her risk for adverse outcomes before initiating this therapy. Given her age and the presence of peripheral arterial disease, she would likely qualify for anticoagulation to prevent stroke. Additionally, if she is considering catheter ablation or antiarrhythmic drug therapy, ongoing management with antithrombotic therapy is advised to align with the recommendations for patients with atrial fibrillation."

The AHA/ACC/Heart Rhythm Society guidelines for AF recommend use of the CHA DS 2 -VASc score (history of hypertension, age ‚â•75 [doubled weight], diabetes mellitus, previous stroke or transient ischemic attack or thromboembolism [doubled weight], vascular disease, age 65 to 74 years, sex category) to assess patient risk for adverse outcomes before initiating anticoagulation therapy (1,27,28). Regardless of whether patients receive rhythm or rate control, anticoagulation is recommended for patients with HF and AF for stroke prevention with a CHA DS 2 -VASc score of ‚â•2 (for men) and ‚â•3 (for women) (2-5).\\n\\n# 2.\\n\\nTrials of DOAC have compared the efficacy and safety with warfarin therapy rather than placebo. Several DOAC are available, including the factor Xa inhibitors apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, and the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran (2-5). These drugs do not need routine anticoagulation monitoring or dose adjustment. The fixed dosing together with fewer interactions may simplify patient management, particularly with the polypharmacy commonly seen in HF, but cost for some patients can be prohibitive when not covered by insurance. These drugs have a potential for an improved benefit‚Äìrisk profile compared with warfarin, which may increase their use in practice, especially in those at increased bleeding risk (6-9). In a meta-analysis of 4 trials examining efficacy and safety of DOAC in patients with and without HF, DOAC more effectively reduced the rate of stroke or systemic embolism, major bleeding, and intracranial bleeding compared with warfarin, with no treatment heterogeneity by HF status (10).\\n\\n# 3.\\n\\nThe 2 largest RCTs of AF ablation in HF showed a benefit in hospitalizations and mortality with ablation (11,12) although other smaller trials did not. In the AATAC (Ablation Versus Amiodarone for Treatment of Persistent Atrial Fibrillation in Patients with Congestive Heart Failure and an Implanted Device) trial, 203 patients with persistent AF, LVEF <40%, and NYHA class II to III HF, ablation improved the likelihood of maintaining normal sinus rhythm at 24 months compared with amiodarone and, in addition, had a 45% decrease in hospitalization and decrease in mortality (8% vs. 18%) (11). The CASTLE AF (Catheter Ablation for Atrial Fibrillation with Heart Failure) trial randomized 363 patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF, LVEF <35%, NYHA class II to IV HF, and ICD to ablation versus standard medical care (12). The composite endpoint of death or rehospitalization was lower in ablation (28.5%) compared with standard care (44.6%). In addition, there was a lower mortality in the ablation group. In a meta-analysis of 11 RCTs comparing rhythm versus rate control, patients undergoing catheter ablation had improved survival (49% relative risk reduction) and reduced hospitalizations (56% relative risk reduction) (13).\\n\\n# 4.\\n\\nIf a rhythm control strategy fails or is undesired, and ventricular rates remain rapid despite medical therapy after all other options are exhausted, atrioventricular nodal ablation with implantation of a CRT device can be considered as a treatment option. Ablate and pace is an old strategy for difficult to rate control AF. Early studies with RV pacing showed benefit (15,16). However, when RV pacing was compared with cardiac resynchronization in more recent trials, especially in those with reduced LVEFs, CRT generally produced more benefit than RV pacing (17-21). The PAVE (Left Ventricular-Based Cardiac Stimulation post AV Nodal Ablation Evaluation) and the BLOCK-HF (Biventricular versus Right Ventricular Pacing in Patients with AV block) trials included patients with LVEF >35%, with mean EF 46% (22) in PAVE and 40% in BLOCK-HF (enrolled #50%).

These drugs act by suppressing triggers and altering atrial tissue refractoriness. Individual properties of each drug need to be considered for proper use. Much of the data pertaining to use of amiodarone in management of atrial arrhythmias has been derived from use in patients with AF(10). Few data are available for patients with atrial flutter. Amiodarone has significant toxicities, so it is used only when other treatments are contraindicated or ineffective. Nevertheless, administration is reasonable, particularly in patients with heart failure or significant underlying heart disease (376).\\n\\nDofetilide may be more effective than many other drugs but must be started in an inpatient setting (346,377). The dose is adjusted on the basis of renal function, with close monitoring of the Q-T interval and subsequent monitoring for altered renal function.\\n\\nSotalol, a class III antiarrhythmic, is generally well tolerated but is associated with typical beta blocker side effects, such as fatigue and bradycardia (378). The major potential cardiac toxicity for both drugs is torsades de pointes.\\n\\n# 2.\\n\\nCatheter ablation is reasonable in patients with CTI-dependent atrial flutter that occurs as the result of flecainide, propafenone, or amiodarone used for treatment of AF (317,379‚Äì381).\\n\\nSee Online Data Supplements 16 and 17.\\n\\nSome patients with AF treated with propafenone, flecainide, or amiodarone will develop atrial flutter. In this circumstance, if flutter becomes the dominant arrhythmia, ablation of the CTI and continued use of the antiarrhythmic drug can decrease the incidence of atrial flutter and facilitate the pharmacological management of AF (379,380).\\n\\n# 3.\\n\\nCatheter ablation of the CTI is reasonable in patients undergoing catheter ablation of AF who also have a history of documented clinical or induced CTI-dependent atrial flutter (381,382).\\n\\nSee Online Data Supplements 16 and 17.\\n\\nThe indications for catheter ablation of AF are discussed in the 2014 AF guideline (10). When AF and atrial flutter coexist, 1 randomized study demonstrated that at 1-year follow-up, greater success in terms of arrhythmia suppression and quality-of-life score resulted from AF ablation (with or without atrial flutter ablation) than from atrial flutter ablation alone (381). It may be that AF ablation alone is sufficient to control both arrhythmias, although CTI ablation reduced the early postablation arrhythmia recurrence rate (382).\\n\\n# 4.\\n\\nCatheter ablation is reasonable in patients with recurrent symptomatic non‚ÄìCTI-dependent flutter as primary therapy, before therapeutic trials of antiarrhythmic drugs, after carefully weighing potential risks and benefits of treatment options (135).\\n\\nSee Online Data Supplement 17.\\n\\nNo prospective RCTs have compared the efficacy or safety of antiarrhythmic drugs with that of catheter ablation for non‚ÄìCTI-dependent atrial flutter. Observational data, however, support the relative effectiveness and safety of catheter ablation in experienced centers (135,327). Many of the atrial flutters that are observed during the first 3 months after ablation or cardiac surgery will not persist beyond the periprocedural period, so attempts at ablation can be deferred unless attempts at pharmacological therapy or cardioversion are unsuccessful (135).\\n\\n# 1.\\n\\nFlecainide or propafenone may be considered to maintain sinus rhythm in patients without structural heart disease or ischemic heart disease who have symptomatic recurrent atrial flutter (383‚Äì385).\\n\\nSee Online Data Supplements 16 and 17.\\n\\nData to support the recommendation for flecainide and propafenone for\\n'"

Surgical ablation of AT or atrial flutter can be effective in ACHD patients undergoing planned surgical repair (497‚Äì508).\\n\\nIIa B-NR\\n\\nSee Online Data Supplement 20.\\n\\nIn patients with symptomatic SVT undergoing planned surgical repairs of structural heart disease or ischemic heart disease, observation studies report that arrhythmia surgery can be integrated into the operation with high efficacy and without increased surgical morbidity (497‚Äì500). In populations including those with tetralogy of Fallot/double-outlet right ventricle, tricuspid valve repairs, and ASD, rates of freedom from recurrent AT or atrial flutter have been reported as 73% to 93% without antiarrhythmic medications during medium-term follow-up of 2.5 to 10 years. Catheter ablation may be attempted in specialized centers before surgical Fontan repair. There are no RCTs comparing efficacy of catheter versus surgical ablation of AT or atrial flutter in patients with prior Fontan repairs. The incidence of AT or atrial flutter in patients with prior Fontan repairs approaches 60% and increases with advancing age. Catheter ablation success rates in this subset of patients are lower than for other lesions (457), with acute success in 54% to 75%, and with recurrent AT in 27% to 50% of patients within 2 to 4 years (490,495); death or transplantation was reported in 27% during follow-up. Several observational studies of surgical resection and ablation for AT or atrial flutter associated with Fontan conversion reported rates of freedom from AT of 12% to 16% during follow-up extending to 8 years (501‚Äì505); death or transplantation was reported in 6% to 14% during follow-up. Performance of a modified right atrial maze procedure versus CTI ablation was associated with lower recurrence rates (501). Alternatively, surgical repairs without arrhythmia intervention are associated with high recurrence rates of AT. Arrhythmia surgery can be combined with hemodynamic surgical revision with low mortality rate and improved medium-term freedom from arrhythmia recurrence and death in this population.\\n\\n1. Atrial pacing may be reasonable to decrease recurrences of AT or atrial flutter in ACHD patients and sinus node dysfunction (472,509,510).\\n\\nIIb B-NR\\n\\nSee Online Data Supplement 20.\\n\\nSmall observational studies support the use of atrial pacing in patients with recurrent AT or atrial flutter to reduce the frequency of tachycardia episodes. The pacing rate is programmed to maintain atrial pacing for the majority of the time in patients with sinus node dysfunction, significantly reducing tachycardia recurrences to 11% in 1 study (509,510). In addition, the implanted pacemaker can be used for termination of recurrent episodes of AT or atrial flutter (472).\\n\\n2. Oral dofetilide may be reasonable for prevention of recurrent AT or atrial flutter in ACHD patients (447,474,487,488).\\n\\nIIb B-NR\\n\\nSee Online Data Supplement 20.\\n\\nTwo small observational studies on the use of oral dofetilide for ACHD patients report a high rate of acute conversion of AT or atrial flutter, with longer-term efficacy of the drug (defined by either complete suppression or partial improvement of symptoms) ranging from 70% to 85%. The benefit was tempered by an association with torsades de pointes in 10% (471,484). Although many patients continued to experience recurrence, these episodes were better tolerated and were of limited duration (471,484). Because of the potential risk of proarrhythmia, dofetilide is usually a second-line medication after failure of beta blockers and sotalol. Initiation of oral dofetilide is recommended during 72-hour inpatient monitoring.\\n\\n3. Amiodarone may be reasonable for prevention of recurrent AT or atrial flutter in ACHD patients for whom other medications and catheter ablation are ineffective or contraindicated (447).\\n\\nIIb B-NR\\n\\nSee Online Data Supplement 20.\\n\\nAn observational study reported efficacy of amiodarone in maintaining sinus rhythm, although side effects were noted frequently, including thyroid disorders or AV block (447).

      "Final Answer: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a heart condition where the heart beats irregularly and often rapidly. Managing AF involves several treatment options that can be tailored to each patient's needs. Here‚Äôs a simplified explanation of the options available:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Medications:**\n",
      "   - **Antiarrhythmic Drugs:** These medications help restore and maintain a normal heart rhythm. They may include drugs like flecainide or amiodarone. The choice of medication depends on the patient's specific condition and history.\n",
      "   - **Rate Control Medications:** These drugs, such as beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers, help slow down the heart rate, making the heart beat more effectively during AF episodes.\n",
      "   - **Anticoagulants:** To prevent blood clots, which can lead to strokes, patients may be prescribed blood thinners like warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). The choice of anticoagulant will depend on the patient's overall risk profile.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Lifestyle Changes:**\n",
      "   - **Diet:** A heart-healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can support heart health. Reducing salt and limiting alcohol and caffeine can also be beneficial.\n",
      "   - **Exercise:** Regular physical activity can enhance cardiovascular fitness. However, patients should consult their doctor about the type and intensity of exercise appropriate for them.\n",
      "   - **Stress Management:** Techniques such as mindfulness, yoga, or meditation can help reduce stress, which may trigger AF episodes.\n",
      "   - **Sleep Hygiene:** Ensuring adequate sleep and addressing any sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea, is crucial, as poor sleep can exacerbate AF.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Procedures:**\n",
      "   - **Cardioversion:** This procedure can be done electrically or chemically to reset the heart's rhythm back to a normal sinus rhythm. It may be an option for patients with recent onset AF.\n",
      "   - **Catheter Ablation:** This minimally invasive procedure involves threading a catheter through the blood vessels to the heart, where it delivers energy to specific areas to destroy the small bits of heart tissue that are causing AF. This can significantly reduce or eliminate episodes of AF.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given Sarah Johnson's preference for minimally invasive procedures, catheter ablation may be a particularly appealing option for her, as it specifically targets the areas of the heart responsible for AF without the need for major surgery. However, antiarrhythmic therapy may also be considered if she prefers to start with medication. The choice between these options should take into account her overall health, the severity of her AF, and her personal preferences.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, a combination of these treatments, tailored to her specific needs and preferences, will help manage her atrial fibrillation effectively while minimizing discomfort and risks. Regular follow-ups will also be essential to monitor her progress and make any necessary adjustments to her treatment plan.\u001b[0m\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Medications:**\n",
      "   - **Antiarrhythmic Drugs:** These medications help restore and maintain a normal heart rhythm. They may include drugs like flecainide or amiodarone. The choice of medication depends on the patient's specific condition and history.\n",
      "   - **Rate Control Medications:** These drugs, such as beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers, help slow down the heart rate, making the heart beat more effectively during AF episodes.\n",
      "   - **Anticoagulants:** To prevent blood clots, which can lead to strokes, patients may be prescribed blood thinners like warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). The choice of anticoagulant will depend on the patient's overall risk profile.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Lifestyle Changes:**\n",
      "   - **Diet:** A heart-healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can support heart health. Reducing salt and limiting alcohol and caffeine can also be beneficial.\n",
      "   - **Exercise:** Regular physical activity can enhance cardiovascular fitness. However, patients should consult their doctor about the type and intensity of exercise appropriate for them.\n",
      "   - **Stress Management:** Techniques such as mindfulness, yoga, or meditation can help reduce stress, which may trigger AF episodes.\n",
      "   - **Sleep Hygiene:** Ensuring adequate sleep and addressing any sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea, is crucial, as poor sleep can exacerbate AF.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Procedures:**\n",
      "   - **Cardioversion:** This procedure can be done electrically or chemically to reset the heart's rhythm back to a normal sinus rhythm. It may be an option for patients with recent onset AF.\n",
      "   - **Catheter Ablation:** This minimally invasive procedure involves threading a catheter through the blood vessels to the heart, where it delivers energy to specific areas to destroy the small bits of heart tissue that are causing AF. This can significantly reduce or eliminate episodes of AF.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given Sarah Johnson's preference for minimally invasive procedures, catheter ablation may be a particularly appealing option for her, as it specifically targets the areas of the heart responsible for AF without the need for major surgery. However, antiarrhythmic therapy may also be considered if she prefers to start with medication. The choice between these options should take into account her overall health, the severity of her AF, and her personal preferences.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, a combination of these treatments, tailored to her specific needs and preferences, will help manage her atrial fibrillation effectively while minimizing discomfort and risks. Regular follow-ups will also be essential to monitor her progress and make any necessary adjustments to her treatment plan.\n",

    "The CrewAI agent-based system in your example executed a multi-step process to generate a Patient Decision Aid Document for Sarah Johnson, leveraging the expertise of specialized agents. Here's a breakdown of what was happening under the hood at each stage of the process:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Task Delegation to Specialized Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "**Agents**: Each agent was assigned a specific role and expertise area to carry out a portion of the task:\n",
    "- **Guideline Expert**: This agent's responsibility was to retrieve and summarize relevant ACC guidelines for treating atrial fibrillation and peripheral arterial disease (PAD), focusing on catheter ablation and antiarrhythmic therapy.\n",
    "- **Patient Educator**: This agent translated the medical guidelines into patient-friendly language so that Sarah could easily understand her treatment options.\n",
    "- **Treatment Planner**: This agent created a personalized treatment plan based on Sarah's preference for minimally invasive procedures, as well as considering options for catheter ablation or antiarrhythmic therapy.\n",
    "- **Output Generator**: The final agent compiled all the information into a comprehensive decision aid document for Sarah, combining the retrieved guidelines, patient-friendly language, and the personalized treatment plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Sequential Execution of Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "The system used a sequential process, meaning that each task had to be completed before moving on to the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Retrieve ACC Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Guideline Expert began by querying the ACC guidelines for managing atrial fibrillation and PAD. The key focus was on the treatment options, including catheter ablation and antiarrhythmic therapy.\n",
    "- There were a few retries due to input validation errors when querying the tool (e.g., incorrect format), but eventually, the agent retrieved and summarized the guidelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Translate Guidelines into Patient-Friendly Language\n",
    "\n",
    "- Once the guidelines were retrieved, the Patient Educator translated the medical jargon into simplified terms that Sarah could understand. The agent detailed the treatment options (medications, lifestyle changes, and procedures) in a clear and friendly manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create a Personalized Treatment Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Treatment Planner used the guidelines and Sarah's specific preferences (e.g., minimally invasive treatments) to develop a customized treatment plan. This plan included details on catheter ablation and antiarrhythmic therapy, as well as lifestyle changes and follow-up care.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generate the Decision Aid Document\n",
    "\n",
    "- The final agent, the Output Generator, compiled all of the information from the previous tasks into a formatted decision aid document. This included a clear structure, headings, and patient-specific instructions for Sarah to review with her healthcare provider.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Final Output: Patient Decision Aid Document\n",
    "\n",
    "The entire process resulted in a comprehensive document that Sarah Johnson can use to understand her condition, treatment options, lifestyle recommendations, and next steps. This document includes:\n",
    "- **Introduction**: Overview of the purpose of the document.\n",
    "- **Treatment Options**: Detailed explanations of catheter ablation and antiarrhythmic medications in a format that a patient can understand.\n",
    "- **Lifestyle Changes**: Recommendations on diet, exercise, and stress management to improve heart health.\n",
    "- **Follow-Up Care**: Instructions on follow-up appointments and monitoring heart rhythm.\n",
    "- **Patient Education**: Important tips on recognizing atrial fibrillation symptoms and the importance of adhering to the treatment plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Error Handling & Retry Mechanism\n",
    "\n",
    "- Throughout the process, there were input validation errors (e.g., when querying tools or delegating tasks), but the agents had built-in mechanisms to retry and correct the input until the correct format was used.\n",
    "- For example, the Guideline Expert had to adjust the query format to retrieve the correct ACC guidelines, ensuring the output was aligned with Sarah's condition and needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Multi-Agent Collaboration\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each agent contributed to the final result through specialized collaboration, and the system ensured that the tasks were coordinated efficiently. The agents were designed to \"ask\" for help when needed, ensuring that the tasks were completed with all necessary context.\n",
    "- The sequential task execution ensured that each step built upon the previous one, ultimately leading to a complete and accurate decision aid document.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary of Process Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Guideline Retrieval**: Summarized ACC guidelines relevant to Sarah's condition.\n",
    "- **Patient-Friendly Translation**: Explained the treatment options in simple terms.\n",
    "- **Personalized Treatment Plan**: Created a plan tailored to Sarah‚Äôs preferences and health profile.\n",
    "- **Decision Aid Compilation**: Generated a comprehensive patient document for Sarah's review.\n",
    "\n",
    "This structured, step-by-step approach ensures that Sarah receives a well-rounded and detailed decision aid, helping her make informed choices about her health care."
