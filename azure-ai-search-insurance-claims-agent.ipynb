    "# Insurance Claim Analysis Scenario with Semantic Kernel and Azure OpenAI Assistants API\n",
    "\n",
    "## Context\n",
    "\n",
    "In May 2024, Hurricane Alicia strikes the Gulf Coast near Houston, Texas, causing extensive property damage. Fabrikam Insurance, a leading commercial insurer, now faces numerous complex claims. One such claim is from Contoso Electronics Inc. for their retail location #TX-230 in Houston.\n",
    "\n",
    "The claim involves severe roof damage, flooding of inventory storage, compromised electrical systems, and potential business interruption. The insurer’s underwriting and claims team uses Semantic Kernel agents to orchestrate a multi-step analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Review** the claim details from the adjuster’s report.\n",
    "- **Verify** policy coverage, deductibles, and limits.\n",
    "- **Assess** the severity of damage, detect any fraud indicators, and recommend next steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multi-Agent Process Using Semantic Kernel's Agent Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "We orchestrate a multi-agent process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Claims Analyst**: Reviews claim documents, identifies key details, and notes any missing information.\n",
    "2. **Policy Verifier**: Checks coverage limits, applies correct deductibles, and identifies endorsements or exclusions.\n",
    "3. **Risk Assessor**: Evaluates the severity of the incident against the weather data, assesses mitigation efforts, and provides forward-looking recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `AgentGroupChat` coordinates these agents until a final recommendation is formed."
