    "# Azure AI Search with LlamaIndex and TruLens\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the use of Azure AI Search in conjunction with OpenAI, Ragas, and Langchain. The goal is to evaluate a Langchain AI Search vector store based on the following metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Context Precision**: Measures whether the relevant chunks for answering the question are present in the context and ranked highly.\n",
    "- **Context Recall**: Assesses whether the retrieved chunks align with the ground truth answer in our evaluation test set of questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to RAG Triad by TruLens\n",
    "\n",
    "RAGs (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) have become the standard architecture for providing LLMs (Large Language Models) with context to avoid hallucinations. However, even RAGs can suffer from hallucination when retrieval fails to provide sufficient or relevant context. TruEra's RAG Triad evaluates hallucinations along three edges of the RAG architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Context Relevance\n",
    "The first step of any RAG application is retrieval; to verify the quality of our retrieval, we want to make sure that each chunk of context is relevant to the input query. This is critical because this context will be used by the LLM to form an answer, so any irrelevant information in the context could be weaved into a hallucination. TruLens enables you to evaluate context relevance by using the structure of the serialized record.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Groundedness\n",
    "After the context is retrieved, it is then formed into an answer by an LLM. LLMs are often prone to stray from the facts provided, exaggerating or expanding to a correct-sounding answer. To verify the groundedness of our application, we can separate the response into individual claims and independently search for evidence that supports each within the retrieved context.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Answer Relevance\n",
    "Our response still needs to helpfully answer the original question. We can verify this by evaluating the relevance of the final response to the user input.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Putting it together\n",
    "By reaching satisfactory evaluations for this triad, we can make a nuanced statement about our application’s correctness; our application is verified to be hallucination-free up to the limit of its knowledge base. In other words, if the vector database contains only accurate information, then the answers provided by the RAG are also accurate.\n"
