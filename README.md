# Azure AI Search Python Playground üåê

Welcome to the **Azure AI Search Python Playground**! This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks designed to explore the various capabilities of Azure AI Search. You'll find experiments focused on vector search, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and other retrieval system tasks using OpenAI's embedding models. Each notebook is a standalone experiment with detailed explanations to help you understand the concepts and apply them in your own projects.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To begin experimenting with these notebooks, set up your Azure AI environment with the following steps:

1. **Set Up an Azure Account**: Ensure you have an Azure account. If not, you can [sign up for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

2. **Create Azure AI Resources**: Follow the [Azure AI documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/) to create the necessary resources, including Azure OpenAI service instances.

3. **Clone This Repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine or Azure Notebooks environment:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/farzad528/azure-ai-search-python-playground.git
   ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Install Dependencies

Each notebook specifies its dependencies at the beginning. To ensure a smooth experience:

1. **Open the Notebook**: Navigate to the notebook of interest.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Follow the markdown instructions at the top of each notebook to install the necessary Python packages.

3. **Use a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**: It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment (via `conda`, `virtualenv`, or Python's built-in `venv` module) to avoid conflicts between project dependencies.

By following the in-notebook instructions, you can ensure that all necessary dependencies for a given experiment are correctly installed.

## üìö How to Use

Each notebook is self-contained and includes step-by-step instructions to guide you through the experiments. To get started, simply open a notebook in your Jupyter environment and follow the provided instructions.
