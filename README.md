# Azure AI Search Python Playground

Welcome to the Azure AI Search Python Playground! This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks that explore various capabilities of Azure AI Search, including vector search, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and other retrieval system tasks using OpenAI's embeddings models. Each notebook is designed as a standalone experiment and includes detailed explanations to help you understand the concepts and apply them in your own projects.

## Notebooks

Below is a list of the notebooks currently available in this repository:

1. [**Azure AI Search OpenAI Text-Embedding-3-Large Model Exploration**](azure-ai-search-text-embedding-3-large.ipynb) - This notebook demonstrates how to use the new OpenAI embeddings models within Azure AI Search. Learn how to generate embeddings for text data and use these embeddings for vector search tasks.

## Getting Started

To get started with these notebooks, you'll need to set up your Azure AI environment. Here's a quick guide:

1. **Set Up Azure Account**: Ensure you have an Azure account. If not, you can [sign up for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

2. **Create Azure AI Resources**: Follow the [Azure AI documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/) to create the necessary resources, including Azure OpenAI service instances.

3. **Clone This Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine or Azure Notebooks environment to get started with the experiments.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/farzad528/azure-ai-search-python-playground.git
   ```

## Install Dependencies

Each notebook in this repository contains its specific dependency installations at the beginning of the notebook. To ensure a smooth experience:

1. **Open the Notebook**: Navigate to the notebook of interest.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Follow the markdown instructions provided at the top of each notebook to install necessary Python packages. This approach keeps each experiment self-contained and allows for flexibility in dependency versions across different notebooks.

3. **Virtual Environment (Recommended)**: While not required, it's highly recommended to use a virtual environment for running the notebooks to avoid potential conflicts between dependencies of different projects. This can be done using `conda`, `virtualenv`, or Python's built-in `venv` module.

By following the in-notebook instructions, you can ensure that all necessary dependencies for a given experiment are correctly installed and configured.


## How to Use

Each notebook in this repository is self-contained and includes step-by-step instructions to guide you through the experiments. To begin, simply open the notebook of interest in your Jupyter environment and follow along with the instructions provided within.
